2) Make changes in your local branch to fix the issue making sure to tag all commits to the issue
-- Example: "#2 changed ui method call"
-- Example: "#2 updated properties"
-- Example: "#2 minor adjustments and code clean up"
3) Merge any changes from the development branch into your "bug/2-UI-Update-Fix" branch
